# AbhiTools Stability Audit

Last updated: 2026-08-26

This file tracks the low-risk smoothness/stability passes added after the feature-complete loan/payment work. The rule for these passes is: protect working financial behavior first, improve responsiveness second, and avoid large rewrites.

## Protected core scope

The following areas should not be rewritten during polish work unless a verified bug requires it:

- EMI/payment ledger rules
- UPI verification and UTR flow
- sequential EMI eligibility
- foreclosure / settlement closing
- recycle bin restore/purge behavior
- manual Loan ID create/edit behavior
- admin authentication boundary
- API financial write semantics

## Phase A — UI Smoothness

- PR: #9
- Main commit: `cf09c83450257fecfa0ebd266a39b16cd1c229f4`
- Added isolated UI motion/touch polish and mobile rendering-cost reductions.
- Financial/API logic changed: No.
- Production verification at merge: READY, 12/12 serverless functions, build errors 0, new runtime errors 0.

## Phase B — Frontend Performance

- PR: #10
- Main commit: `f53f68e91fcdfd6f67b4206b65f233d6e765e7a0`
- Debounced heavy search rendering and coalesced repeated in-flight refresh calls.
- Financial/API logic changed: No.
- Production verification at merge: READY, 12/12 functions, build errors 0, new runtime errors 0.

## Phase C — Server Smoothness

- PR: #11
- Main commit: `770685d0afaca3ccec4468ec45404760405ba0cf`
- Added warm-instance 60-second due-refresh cooldown and concurrent refresh coalescing.
- Loan/borrower/EMI/payment response data is not cached.
- Due/overdue calculation rules changed: No.
- Production live check: first `/api/due` request used `fresh`; immediate second request used `cooldown`, with due-refresh timing reduced to 0 ms on the repeated call.
- Production verification at merge: READY, 12/12 functions, build errors 0.

## Phase D — Network Resilience

- PR: #12
- Branch head at audit entry: `95d880d5eb0786322c094ed2a4429f8d79292f2a`
- Service worker cache: `v9`.
- Same-origin `GET /api/*` reads get at most one retry for transient network failure or HTTP 408/502/503/504.
- Each read attempt has an 8-second timeout and a 350 ms retry delay.
- `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` are never auto-retried by this layer.
- API/auth/financial responses are still never cached by the service worker.
- Database migration: None.
- New serverless function: None.
- Preview before audit-file commit: READY, 12/12 functions, build errors 0.

## Current known audit note

Vercel runtime diagnostics still report an intermittent Node `DEP0169 url.parse()` deprecation warning on older `/api/dashboard`, `/api/loans`, and `/api/borrowers` executions. Repo inspection has not found direct `url.parse()` usage in the application code, so no working code is being changed solely to silence that hosting/runtime warning.

## Release verification checklist

Before a polish PR is merged:

1. Compare branch against `main` and confirm changed files match intended scope.
2. Confirm Vercel preview is READY and serverless count remains within Hobby limit (12).
3. Check errors-only build logs.
4. Verify any touched public endpoint returns the expected status/shape.
5. Confirm no financial write route was unintentionally changed.
6. Merge only after PR is mergeable.
7. Verify production deployment READY and check recent runtime errors.

Production verification for Phase D should be recorded in PR #12 after merge so the GitHub history remains the final audit trail.
